# JDBC_Tutorial
This is just a homework where the object was to implement a JDBC driver

## First of all, I installed PostgreSQL from entreprisedb.com
## Once done, I then setup the server in pgAdmin 4 and I have created a database called store, a schema called shop and 7 tables using ChatGPT
## After that, using IntelliJ, I installed a JDBC driver, which is (Maven) org.postgresql:postgresql: 42.6.0
## Then I wrote a code to see all the tables names listed in ListTables.java
## ShowRecords.java shows all the records in products table
